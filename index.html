    <h2>Welcome to my Site!--(STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!)</h2>
    <p>My name is Giovanni, and I am currently an Undergraduate Student at California State University, Long Beach. <br>
    I'm working towards my Bachelors in Computer Science, as well as a future in software programming <br>
    and mobile app development.<br>
    I'm experienced with software ranging from Adobe Photoshop to Google suite, and well versed in <br>
    Object Oriented Programming languages such as Java and C#.<br>
    <br>
    In my free time, I love to program computer games through the game engine Unity 3D.<br>
    I love playing video games as well!<br>
    I also love music very much. I play the drums and guitar, and sing on occasion.<br>
    Nothing gets me in the zone better than a good song!

    <br>
