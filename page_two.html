    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>When I was in high school, I wanted to be a graphic designer. <br>
        I took up Adobe Photoshop for 6 years, taking up comissions.<br>
        When I entered my Sophomore year of highschool, I was so obsessed with video games<br>
        that I wanted to to learn how to make them. 
        <p class="bold"> This Curiosity led me to find my passion for Computer Science. 
    <p>I still practice graphic design to this day, but the majority of my Extra-Curricular work
        is in Video Game Design.<br><br>
        Below is a list of some of the C# Projects I've worked on.   
        You can also visit my Wix website <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://giovanniquevedo5.wixsite.com/gio-made">Here</a> for my Graphic Design Work.<br><br>

    <p>
        Red Dash is my first game ever created using the Unity engine, and it is how I began to teach myself to use Unity. I initially built this game using Youtube tutorials, and then gave it 
        my own spin, designing all of the UI myself. This helped me practice UI Design and got me understanding basic C#. While it's a simple game, I still find it enjoyable to this day (And Very Difficult!).

    Winner of the CSULB VGDA Best Gameplay Award, <br>
    Turret Trouble is a fully fledged production, as a collaboration with 3D Artist named Alexander Radchuck.
    <p>I had started this project for fun, because I thought it would be interesting to make a first person shooter. While the initial goal never came to fruition, 
        the product became the groundwork for Turret Trouble.<br><br>
    Turret Trouble is a beautifully modeled game in which the player has to stand their ground against waves of enemies, with the power of powerups and explosions!
