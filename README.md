## Style - MintyGlass

Thanks for visiting my personal website!

### March 5th
Today, I'm bringing in my new site version. This has been built on more modern CSS than the old one, and includes many JS features as well!
Including:
- Custom Carousel implementation with scroll event listeners
- Encapsulated navbar implementation injected by JS - one and done!
- Dynamic project listings - just add to a set, and watch it populate!
And much more!

Very excited for the chance to work on one of these again, and I'm especially happy for how far we've come!
Lets make great things!
